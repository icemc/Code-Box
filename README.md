# Code-Box
Android app that contains a collection of USSD codes of telephony operators in cameroon.
With this no need to remember USSD codes. You can search using a keyword or better still filter USSD codes depending on their types.
This project was created for people (my parents) who have difficulties remembering USSD codes. So this help them provide a means to dial these codes directly from the application.
Four operators are currently supported which are MTN Cameroon, Orange Cameroon, Nexttel and Camtel.
The app supports two languages French and English and the codes that are shipped with the application are available in both languages.
